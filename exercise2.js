// Let's also practice the different type of button press type of user events that can occur. 

// First, we'll do the regular click event. 
// On the #circle-one element, set an event listener that when you click it, will turn its background color blue.
let circle1 = document.getElementById("circle-one");

circle1.addEventListener("click", () => {
    circle1.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
})

// Next, we'll do the event when any key is pressed on the keyboard. 
// On the #circle-two element, set an event listener that when you press any key on the keyboard, will turn its background color green.
let circle2 = document.getElementById("circle-two")

circle2.addEventListener("keypress", () => {
    return circle2.style.backgroundColor =  "green";
})


// Lastly, we'll do the event when the user releases a key on the keyboard. 
// On the #circle-three element, set an event listener that when you release any key on the keyboard, will turn its background color red.
